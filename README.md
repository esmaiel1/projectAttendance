# Attendance project
This is a python code that takes 2 inputs:
  1- A list of names in a txt file.
  2- A list of Excel (CSV) files that contains names of the participated students in several classes (Check WxPx files for examples)
  
The first input is a list of the registered students in a course and it also includes the teacher and coaches names of that course.

The goal of this project is to compare the registered names in the course with the participated names of every class and it will produce 2 files as a result:
  1- A CSV file that contains the attendance percentage of every registered student.
  2- A CSV file that contains all the unknown names (unregistered students) that participated in the classes.
 
 
 All the WxPx files are example files of participated students in several classes.
 AllAttendees.txt is an example of the 1st input  (list of registered students).
 res.csv and unknown_names are examples of the result files.
 
 Notes.txt should be read before using the code for extra information.
