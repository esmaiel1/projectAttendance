AllAttendees.txt: 
This is a file we can define the structure of. We will need to know the full list of students and we will also need to know who the teacher and peercoach are as we will not need their attendance recorded

AllFileNames.txt
This is to give you an idea of the current naming convention of the files I have now. W1 means week 1, P1 means practicum 1. I then say the type of call . For us it is All and quiet room. This is what I do but other teachers may do it differently. However, you can assume that all Files start with WwPp, where w is a number from 1 to 7 and w is a 1 or a 2.

FinalResult.xlsx
This is an example of the output file that I would like to have. Notice that the file is not full and is updated each time attendance is taken.

W1P1All.csv
W1P1QuietRoom.csv
These are some examples of the structure of the files. These cannot be changed. Notice that there may be students that are in both files. For the first iteration all we want to know is that they were in one of the calls. For a later iteration, it might be interesting to know which call.
There may also be students that are in neither file. These are the absent students. There may also be students that are not in the AllAttendees.txt file. It is important that know about these.
